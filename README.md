The monty interpreter interprets monty byte codes

  Monty Byte Code Files: These are files that contain the compiled Monty byte codes. The file containing the monty code has a ".m" extension, though it's not strictly required. Each line in a Monty byte code file represents a single instruction.

 Instructions: In Monty byte code files, instructions consist of two parts: the opcode and its argument. The opcode is like the action you want the computer to perform, and the argument provides additional information or data needed for that action. For example, an opcode could be something like "push" (which means to add something to the stack), and its argument might be a number or a value to push onto the stack.

 Formatting: It's important to note that Monty byte code files follow a specific format. Each instruction (opcode and argument) is written on its own line. Also, you can have any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument. This flexibility in spacing allows for easier readability of the code.
